# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This app will help medical practitioners detect whether a patient has heart disease or not based on the records they have obtained. The data used is the cleveland heart disease dataset obtained from [UCI Machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease). Random Forest Classifier algorithm was used to train the model with streamlit UI and streamlit deployment.

https://github.com/calistomeric/Heart-Disease-Prediction/blob/main/heart%20disease.ipynb file contains the analysis of the dataset.Through exploratory data analysis it highlights the various factors affecting heart disease and the order in which they do.
https://github.com/calistomeric/Heart-Disease-Prediction/blob/main/streamlit_app.py file contains the streamlit information responsible for the UI.
